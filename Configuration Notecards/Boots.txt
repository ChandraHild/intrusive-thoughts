You find yourself yearning to be wrapped around Hana's feet.
It is so cold and lonely without Hana's lovely feet inside of you.
It feels wonderful to be stepped on.
You are destined to be a simple piece of clothing, an exquisite pair of latex boots.
Nothing compares to just giving in and supporting your owner as she walks miles and miles upon you.
Boots do not needs a name, they are simply boots.
Boots hate having to move on their own. Boots are to be worn.
The image of Hana's feet pushing into your snug shaft suddenly invade your mind.

█MUTE_MSG
A thought enters your mind: A mere pair of boots has nothing to add to the conversation, as your wearer's gaze lands upon you, you find your desire to speak dwindle.
█UNMUTE_MSG
You feel that your contribution to the conversation is desired by your wearer.
█DEAFEN_MSG
You suddenly feel that the conversation going on around your wearer is unimportant to a simple pair of boots.
█UNDEAFEN_MSG
Suddenly, a flicker of consciousness hits you and you notice the ongoing conversation once more.
█BLIND_MSG
You feel blindness overtake you quickly at your Wearer's will.
█UNBLIND_MSG
You blink slowly as your vision returns at your Wearer's whim, and you see clearly once more.
█MIND_OFF_MSG
As your Wearer levels her gaze upon you, you find your free will dwindle, reduced to only what she wills you to say.
█MIND_ON_MSG
Slowly, you can feel all your free will and returning.

yes=/me nods.
no=/me shakes his head.
explain=/me speaks in a flat tone, "I am boots. I have no free will. I can only respond in pre-defined ways as defined by my wearer."
purpose=I am merely a pair of boots. My more human appearance at the moment is mere coincidence.
