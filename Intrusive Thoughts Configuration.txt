# Tp lines configure pre-set locations for the tpto and tpme commands

objectprefix = Avatar's

# Spoof configuration:
# %ME% is replaced with the name set above
# %VIC% is replaced with the name of the victim
# %OBJ% is replaced with the name of the object they're turning into
# %TAR% is the target rezzed furniture

# The capture and release phrases used when someone is turned into an object
# and when they're released again.
capture = %ME% turns %VIC% into their %OBJ%.
release = %ME% releases their %OBJ% and turns it back into %VIC%.

# You can also override these phrases for specific objects, like so:
#capture:test = %ME% uses her amazing debugging powers to turn %VIC% into a test!
#release:test = %ME% uses her amazing debugging powers to release %VIC% from her fate as a test!

# The pick up and put down phrases used when an object is transferred to rezzed
# furniture. Note that you have the freedom for these to be different kinds of
# objects.
puton = %ME% picks up the %TAR% and turns it into their %OBJ%.
putdown = %ME% puts down their %OBJ% and turns it into a %TAR%.

# Set the following to 2 if you want to fully hide the captured avatars, but they may
# need to teleport to another region to become visible again. If you are okay with
# just pushing them beneath the ground, set it to 1.

# This is what will show as name when your food tries to talk. In this case, it would show as "Hana's Prey"
food = Prey

# These are the phrases uttered when eating and releasing someone. %OBJ% in this case will be replaced with
# the term defined above.
vore = %ME% eats %VIC%, now their %OBJ%.
unvore = %ME% releases their %OBJ%.

# These are the phrases used when possessing and releasing someone. %OBJ% cannot be used here.
possess = %ME% gazes deeply into %VIC%'s eyes as they slowly lose control over their body...
unpossess = %ME% releases her control over %VIC%, as they find their control over their own body returning...
